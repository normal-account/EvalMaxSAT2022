The directory structure is the same as the directory structure of the SAT solver
directory of IPASIR. See ../sat/README for a detailed description.

Briefly put, each subdirectory here corresponds to a MaxSAT solver which
implements IPAMIR as a static library. The directory must be named after the
signature of the MaxSAT solver as returned by 'ipamir_signature'.

Each directory contains a makefile (e.g. 'solver2022/makefile') with the default
goal of compiling the solver and including everything into one static library
(e.g. 'solver2022/libipamirsolver2022.a').

These target libraries must have a generic name

<IPAMIRSOLVER>/libipamir<IPAMIRSOLVER>.a

where IPAMIRSOLVER is the signature of the MaxSAT Å›olver.

Optionally, '<IPAMIRSOLVER>/LINK' specifies the required link command
(e.g. 'g++'). If this file does not exist, 'gcc' is used for linking.

Optionally, '<IPAMIRSOLVER>/LIBS' specifies additional libraries (e.g. '-lz').
If this file does not exist, no additional libraries are needed.

You may assume that the IPAMIR header is available as '../../ipamir.h' from the
solver directory.
